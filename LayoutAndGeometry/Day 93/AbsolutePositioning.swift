/// The three step layout process of SwiftUI :
/// `1`A parent view proposes a size for its child .
/// `2`Based on that information ,
/// the child then chooses its own size
/// and the parent must respect that choice .
/// `3`The parent then positions the child in its coordinate space .
/// So , the parent is responsible for positioning the child , not the child .
